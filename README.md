Requirements

You have been commissioned to design and build a database for a taxi company. The system should be built using the MongoDB database management system. The system is required to store information about the Company according to the requirements below.

1) Drivers: including details of where they live, their other contact details and information about their employment record with the Company, including previous roles, any disciplinary procedures etc.

2) Cars: details of the registration number, registration date, date of last MOT test, status of cars: e.g., roadworthy, in for service, awaiting repair, written off, details of who owns the car.

3) Operators: the taxi firm employs 8 operators who take bookings and allocate them to drivers.

4) Bookings: details of bookings taken over the telephone. These details will include who made the booking and when, number of passengers, start and ending point of the journey, whether a particular type of vehicle is required, other special requirements, 

5) Payments: you need to decide how the details of payments are collected and associated with the correct booking.

6) Shifts: the drivers work a shift system to ensure the Company is effective over 24 hours. You need to be able to track which drivers are on which shift. Similarly, the operators work a shift system to cover each 24-hour period.
 
7)  Clients: in addition to taking whatever one-off bookings come in via the phone, the Company has several registered clients who have regular bookings. There are two types of clients, corporate and private. Clients can make regular bookings, the details of which must be stored. For example, these may be for daily bookings, once weekly bookings and so on.

8) Revenue: you need to be able to record the amount of money earned by drivers and the amount paid by them to the Company (to cover costs of car maintenance, salaries of operators, lighting, heating, and general taxi office costs). Drivers can be employed by the Company either on a fixed-fee or percentage-of-receipts basis.
